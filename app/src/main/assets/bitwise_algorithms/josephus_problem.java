/**
 * This problem is named after Flavius Josephus a Jewish historian who fought against the Romans. According to Josephus him and his group of Jewish soldiers were cornered & surrounded by the Romans inside a cave and they chose murder and suicide inside of surrender and capture. They decided that all the soldiers will sit in a circle and starting from the soldier sitting at the first position every soldier will kill the soldier to their in a sequential way. So if there are 5 soldiers sitting in a circle with positions numbered as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The soldier 1 kills 2, then 3 kills 4, then 5 kills 1, then 3 kills 5 and since 3 is the only one left then 3 commits suicide.
 *
 * Now Josephus doesnâ€™t want to get murdered or commit suicide. He would rather be captured by the Romans and is presented with a problem. He has to figure out at which position should he sit in a circle (provided there are n men in total and the man sitting at position 1 gets the first chance to murder) so that he is the last man standing and instead of committing suicide he will surrender to the Romans.
